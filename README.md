 Hi there 👋
## I am a cs and ai development major, producing odd codes for the fun of it. 
## first of all, dont compare me to that walking pr hazard. Second of all, I'm the strongest dude.

Current projects: minesweeper copy with difficulties, hang man with various difficulties, and game alteration codes.

personal information: I am a 19 year old computer science major who is double majoring in ai development. I have done IT work as well as website alterations. Currently, I am focused on testing the limits of premade codes for video games, websites and more in order to see if I can increase the output for them.
